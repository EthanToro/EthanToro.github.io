        <p><strong>Oil-injected, oil-cooled rotary screw compressors with variable speed drive+, 7-15 kW / 10-20
                hp</strong></p>
        <p>Atlas Copco's GA VSD+ range brings a game-changing innovation to the general industry. The GA 7-15 VSD+
            variable speed drive compressor reduces your energy consumption by a staggering 50% on average, compared to
            idling compressors. At the same time, it offers improved performance, silent operation (down to 62 dB(A))
            and
            a compact footprint, thanks to its vertical drive train design.</p>
        <p>The heart of the GA VSD+ is an interior permanent magnet motor, directly coupled to Atlas Copco's
            best-in-class screw element: all of which have been designed in-house and have patents pending. All these
            benefits make the GA VSD+ the compressor of the future, setting a new standard in the industry for years to
            come.</p>
